## Working Papers

1. Appeal to the Public: Why Leaders Make Public Threats.  [[Draft](https://www.dropbox.com/s/3tw534b6gta1f2i/Park_Yohan_Writingsample_public_concerns.pdf?dl=0){:target="_blank"}]
```{toggle} [See abstract]
Why do leaders go public? During an armed crisis, leaders have strong concerns about the public's evaluation of their conflict behavior. I argue that leaders issue public threats, especially ambiguous ones, to address these concerns. Using public statements, leaders can provide domestic audiences with information on their progress in the crisis, reframe the issues at stake, and make a justification for the decisions they have made or will make further. Moreover, leaders strategically embrace ambiguity within their public statements to satisfy broader audiences with heterogeneous preferences over how to handle the crisis. I test my argument with a novel measure of the US leaders' perceived public concerns during the Vietnam War. Applying supervised learning methods to the declassified White House documents from 1961 to 1976, I measure the US decision-makers' time-varying concerns about the public's evaluation of their foreign policy. The analysis of the US foreign policy documents finds that leaders are more likely to issue public threats, and they make these threats more ambiguous as they perceive the public to be more concerned about leaders' policy competence in Vietnam. These findings imply that the presence of domestic audiences could undermine the credibility of a state's public threats.
