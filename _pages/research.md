## Working Papers

<summary> 1. Appeal to the Public: Why Leaders Make Public Threats.</summary>  
Why do leaders go public? During an armed crisis, leaders have strong concerns about the public's evaluation of their conflict behavior. I argue that leaders issue public threats, especially ambiguous ones, to address these concerns. Using public statements, leaders can provide domestic audiences with information on their progress in the crisis, reframe the issues at stake, and make a justification for the decisions they have made or will make further. Moreover, leaders strategically embrace ambiguity within their public statements to satisfy broader audiences with heterogeneous preferences over how to handle the crisis. I test my argument with a novel measure of the US leaders' perceived public concerns during the Vietnam War. Applying supervised learning methods to the declassified White House documents from 1961 to 1976, I measure the US decision-makers' time-varying concerns about the public's evaluation of their foreign policy. The analysis of the US foreign policy documents finds that leaders are more likely to issue public threats, and they make these threats more ambiguous as they perceive the public to be more concerned about leaders' policy competence in Vietnam. These findings imply that the presence of domestic audiences could undermine the credibility of a state's public threats.

2. Power structure, domestic constraints, and selective targeting. <details> <summary>[See abstract]</summary>
Previous studies of interstate conflict suggest that leaders who are accountable to domestic audiences have an incentive to target weaker countries in militarized disputes due to the fear of post-defeat domestic punishment. I argue that the effect of domestic audiences on leaders' decisions vary with the international power structure. Under a bipolar structure, minor powers face great uncertainty about dispute outcomes because fierce superpower competition undermines the importance of the balance of power between the disputants. Moreover, the shared concerns about the total war between the two superpowers lead the minor powers to be ambiguous about the superpowers' commitments about support. The dispute outcome uncertainty discourages the leaders with domestic audiences from making risky decisions, whereas it encourages the relatively unconstrained leaders to adopt reckless policies. The analyses of the initiation of militarized disputes between 1946 and 2010 show that regime types with domestic audiences are less likely than personalist regimes to initiate militarized conflicts against stronger opponents in the Cold War period. However, the difference between each non-personalist regime and personalist regime decreases following the end of superpower competition. This finding implies the diminished role of domestic audiences in constraining state leaders during the post-Cold War era.

3. Does the Sector Matter? Deteriorating Political Relations and Foreign Direct Investment. (with [Yoo Sun Jung](https://www.yoosunjung.com/){:target="_blank"}) <details> <summary>[See abstract]</summary> Do political tensions between states disrupt investment flows? Deteriorating political relations may cause negative attitudes towards foreign firms and their products and even retaliatory economic measures. With a hostile political environment, investors expect firms' performance and potential profits to decrease; thus, they perceive the host country riskier. We argue that rising political risk increases as a function of industry fixed asset intensity associated with the irreversibility of investment. We expect that political tensions deter investment for fixed asset-intensive industries because of a substantial increase in investors' perceived risk, but have no such effect for low fixed asset industries, as the increase is not large enough to alter investors' decisions. We test our argument using data on greenfield FDI projects in 126 developing countries during 2003 - 2019. Our analysis finds that political tensions reduce investment in most industries, but not in low fixed asset industries. </details>
